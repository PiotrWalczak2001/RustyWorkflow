## About
**FlowSpell** is a tool to easily create highly configurable workflow scenarios with multiple behaviors handling different events or exceptions. Order tasks to be executed in the background and according to the harmongoram, delay and repeat activities as you need. Manage, create and modify your flows with an intuitive UI downloadable in a separate package, saving you the time you would spend implementing your own solution. In the future, FlowSpell will have tools for third-party integrations and even an innovative flow containerization solution with many capabilities from CI/CD to executing complex processes on other environments. Another helpful feature may be the creation of snapshots of workflows that can be recreated with the same result or changed by adding variables. How you decide to use FlowSpell multitude of functionalities is entirely up to you.
