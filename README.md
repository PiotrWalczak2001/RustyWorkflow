## About

**FlowR** is an easy-to-use tool for building workflow scenarios with extensive configuration options for managing each of its stages goes hand in hand with speed of execution. The solution will help speed up the implementation of the logic responsible for the staged execution of activities and keep the project clean and organised. FlowR is designed for early-stage projects where we do not want to make significant architectural decisions at the outset, and for projects that need some complex procedures but do not want to focus on implementing their own solution.
