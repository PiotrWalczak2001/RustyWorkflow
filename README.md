## About

**FlowR** is a tool that facilitates workflows. Simple scenario building with extensive configuration options for managing each of its stages goes hand in hand with speed of execution. The solution will help speed up the implementation of logic responsible for phased execution of activities and keep the project clean and organized.

## Current Features

Well... I've just started...

## Planned Features

- creation of activity execution scenarios
- background activities without loss of knowledge of status
- setting schedules and activating flows in accordance with them
- conditional flow configuration
- delaying activities
- holding the flow with the possibility of returning to the process
- configuring reactions to defined events and errors
- creation of looped flows
- configuring time limits for the flow and specific activity
- storage of flows
- different strategies for queuing and execution flows

## How to use

Below I will demonstrate with some simple examples how this tool can be used

(work in progress)

## How to install

In the future, after the first version is released, there will be an option to install the package from NuGet and through the command line but currently I am only sharing the code
